If you asked me which episode was my favorite throughout the entire show, I'd say it was season 1 episode 22, Doorway to Helen. It became my favorite because I had a European friend who was a frequent of a streamer I used to go to very often. However, due to timezone, he usually only went there when it was my sleep time and I usually went there when it was my morning time. It was quite rare for us to meet on the stream. Doorway to Helen episode perfectly captured that feeling. The same creek (stream) felt completely different based on the different time you visit!

# Helen appearence

What inspired me to write this entry wasn't exactly the above but the simple fact that she actually appeared again in the season 6 finale!
